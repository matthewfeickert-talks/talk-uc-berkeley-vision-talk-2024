# Vision / Chalk Talk

> For your vision/chalk talk, the committee asks that in addition to addressing your future research plans, we ask that you include in your 45 minute talk a 10 minute overview of your thoughts and efforts in DEIB, including: your understanding of diversity and the current state of diversity in your field, specific activities for improving DEIB that you may have been previously involved in, and specific plans for improving DEIB in the future.
>
> For the faculty only vision talk, feel free to bring a set of slides to set the stage for the discussion and provide any necessary background, as well as material you might expect to use as backup for illustration during. But after the initial setup of your research vision and ideas, you should expect a free-flowing discussion where prepared slides will be of less help.


## EDI

* Working and supporting deaf colleagues
   - Accessibility for everyone
   - Captions benefit many people
* Mentoring seriously

* your understanding of diversity and the current state of diversity in your field
* specific activities for improving DEIB that you may have been previously involved in
* specific plans for improving DEIB in the future

## Future Research

## Particle physics as a rich area for software research for the physical sciences

## Engaging the broader scientific open source ecosystem for advancing science

* Scientific Python
* Julia HEP
* Lots of domain specific ecosystems
* Moving towards having them

## Automatic Differentiation as a tool for doing physics at scale

## Simulation Based Inference

* Need as variational inference isn't fully possible
* Maps well to many physics use cases where things can't

## Open Source Program Office

* X

3 pillars of research that I can focus on

* Data Science for Fundamental Physics / Physical Science
* Differentiable Programming for Current and Future Physics
* Reusable open science as tools for new science

## TODO: Put this into a coherent story

* Intro
* EDI
* Research

# Start

Start with some introductory slides to remind people about who I am and what I do.

* I am a physicist
* I am an IRIS-HEP exectuive board member
* I am a developer of open source scientific software
* I am an associate editor for JOSS
